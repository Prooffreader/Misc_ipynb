Caveats:
"1. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"2. About national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts;"
"population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1"
"resident population; population figures for 2011 are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, from"
"the Vintage 2011 series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012; and population figures for 2012 are bridged-race postcensal estimates"
"of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2012 series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Population Information."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"4. Circumstances in Georgia for the year 2008 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified."" Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies."
"5. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified"" and therefore unusually low"
"death counts in other ICD-10 codes, most notably R95, ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and X40-X49, ""Unintentional poisoning."""
"Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information:"
