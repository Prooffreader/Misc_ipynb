SULU	O'Neil, we've got to keep going. Come on, get up.
O'NEIL	It's no use. They're everywhere.
SULU	The Captain gave us an order. We've got to find some clue.
O'NEIL	It's no use, Mister Sulu. Look, there's one of them. There's another one.
SULU	Scouting party to Enterprise.
SULU	Come in.
KIRK	What is it, Mister Sulu?
SULU	Captain, beam us up quick. Emergency.
KIRK	Transporter room, lock onto Sulu and O'Neil. Beam up immediately.
O'NEIL	We've got to make a run for it. We can't just stand here.
SULU	Mister O'Neil, stand tight. They'll beam us up any minute.
O'NEIL	Run, I tell you. We've got to get out of here. You know what they're capable of.
SULU	O'Neil!
KIRK	Sulu, what is it? Where's Lieutenant O'Neil?
SULU	What? Who?
KIRK	Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he?
SULU	You. You're not of the Body.
KIRK	Doctor McCoy.
SCOTT	Doctor McCoy, transporter room. Quickly.
SULU	You, you did it. They knew we were Archons. These are the clothes they wear, not these.
KIRK	Sulu, take it easy.
SULU	Landru. Landru.
KIRK	Sit down. What happened?
SULU	They're wonderful. They're the sweetest, friendliest people in the universe. It's paradise, my friend. Paradise.
KIRK	Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he?
SULU	Paradise. Paradise.
KIRK	Captain's Log. Stardate 3156.2. While orbiting planet Beta Three trying to find some trace of the starship Archon that disappeared here a hundred years ago, a search party consisting of two Enterprise officers were sent to the planet below. Mister Sulu has returned, but in a highly agitated mental state. His condition requires I beam down with an additional search detail.
KIRK	Materialisation completed. Kirk out.
SPOCK	Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant contentment.
KIRK	Like Sulu. If everybody on this planet is like him. Let's go.
BILAR	Joy to you, friends.
KIRK	Joy to you.
BILAR	You be strangers. Come for the Festival, are ya?
KIRK	Yes.
BILAR	Got a place to sleep it off yet? Go round to Reger's house. He's got rooms. But you'll have to hurry. It's almost the Red Hour.
KIRK	This Festival, it starts at six o'clock?
BILAR	Tula, these folks come for the Festival. Your daddy can put them up, can't he?
TULA	You're from the Valley?
LINDSTROM	We've just arrived.
TULA	My father will be glad to put you up, though. It's right over there.
BILAR	Tula, come!
KIRK	Let's get out of here.
KIRK	I'm sorry to break in on you like this. We didn't expect that kind of a welcome.
TAMAR	Welcome? You are strangers?
KIRK	Yes, that's right. We're from the valley.
HACOM	You came for the Festival?
KIRK	Yes.
HACOM	Then how come you here?
LINDSTROM	Are you Reger?
REGER	Yes.
LINDSTROM	You have a daughter named Tula.
REGER	Yes.
LINDSTROM	Well, you'd better do something. She's outside.
REGER	I know. It's Festival. It's the will of Landru.
HACOM	Reger, these are young men. They are not old enough to be excused.
REGER	They're visitors.
HACOM	Well, have they no Lawgivers in the Valley? Why be they not at the Festival?
KIRK	We heard that you might have rooms for us.
REGER	There. You see, Hacom? They've merely come looking for a place to rest afterwards.
HACOM	The Red Hour has already struck.
TAMAR	Hacom, these be strangers. The Valley has different ways.
HACOM	Do you say that Landru is not everywhere?
TAMAR	No, of course not. It's simply they may have different ways.
REGER	They've come looking for shelter. Can I turn them away? Come, please.
LINDSTROM	But the girl, out there.
HACOM	She is in festival, as you should be.
REGER	Come, please. Hurry.
HACOM	The Lawgivers should know.
TAMAR	Surely, Hacom, they already know. Are they not infallible?
HACOM	You mock them! You mock the Lawgivers. And the strangers are not of the Body. You will see.
TAMAR	But, Hacom
REGER	You can return here at the close of the Festival. It's quiet. You'll have need of rest.
KIRK	We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir.
REGER	The hour is struck. You can hear.
KIRK	I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru.
REGER	Landru? You ask? You're strange. You scorn Festival? Are you? Are you?
KIRK	What about Landru?
RIOTER	Festival! Festival!
KIRK	Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to good use. Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this. Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any. Mister Spock, you and I have some serious thinking to do. When we leave here tomorrow morning, I want to have a plan of action.
KIRK	Spock. Spock, Lindstrom. Doc.
REGER	No, no it's all over now. It's all over now, child. That's all right. Quiet.
MCCOY	Excuse me.
REGER	It's all right. It's all over.
KIRK	He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us.
LINDSTROM	You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind of father are you?
REGER	It's Landru's will.
KIRK	What about Landru? Who is he?
TAMAR	It is true then. You did not attend the Festival last night.
KIRK	No.
REGER	Then you're not of the Body. You couldn't be.
MCCOY	She's asleep.
REGER	Are you, are you Archons?
KIRK	What if we are?
REGER	It was said more would follow. If you are indeed
TAMAR	We must hide them. Quickly. The Lawgivers.
KIRK	We can take care of ourselves.
TAMAR	Landru will know. He will come.
HACOM	He is the one. He mocked the Lawgivers. I heard him.
TAMAR	No, Hacom. It was a jest.
HACOM	The others, they were here, but they scorned the Festival. I saw it.
LAWGIVER	Tamar, stand clear.
TAMAR	I hear and obey the voice of Landru.
LAWGIVER	You attacked the Body. You have heard the Word and disobeyed. You will be absorbed.
KIRK	What do you mean, absorbed?
HACOM	There, you see? Not of the body.
LAWGIVER	You will be absorbed. The Good is all. Landru is gentle. You will come.
KIRK	We're not going anywhere.
LAWGIVER	It is the law. You must come.
KIRK	I said we're not going anywhere.
SPOCK	Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience. How did you know?
KIRK	Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action.
SPOCK	Your analysis seems logical.
LAWGIVER	It is clear that you simply did not understand. I will re-phrase. You are ordered to accompany us to the absorption chambers.
KIRK	Why did you kill that man?
LAWGIVER	Out of order. You will obey. It is the word of Landru.
KIRK	You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him.
LAWGIVER	You cannot. It is Landru.
HACOM	Landru.
SPOCK	Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism.
REGER	They're communing. We have time. Come with me.
KIRK	Where to?
REGER	To a place I know. You'll be safe there, but we must hurry. Landru will come.
KIRK	Quite a festival they had.
REGER	Peace.
KIRK	What do you make of all this?
SPOCK	Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now
KIRK	Now they're back to normal.
BILAR	Morning, friends.
ALL	Good morning, Bilar.
LINDSTROM	Your daughter. That's the man.
REGER	No, it wasn't Bilar. It was Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much time.
REGER	It's too late. Look.
KIRK	What is it?
REGER	Landru. He's summoning the body.
SPOCK	Telepathy, Captain.
KIRK	Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger?
REGER	Perhaps through there, but Landru
KIRK	We'll handle Landru, Just get us out of this.
KIRK	I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back.
REGER	They're in the Body. It's Landru.
KIRK	Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire.
KIRK	Fire.
KIRK	Security.
MCCOY	Captain.
KIRK	Lieutenant O'Neil. He's one of our men.
REGER	Not anymore. He's been absorbed.
KIRK	Bring him along.
REGER	The Lieutenant is one of them. When he wakes, Landru will find us through him. Leave him there. He's our enemy. He's been absorbed.
LINDSTROM	Captain, now that we've got Lieutenant O'Neil, let's beam up out of here.
KIRK	We still don't know what's happened to the Archons. Which way? Bring him along.
MCCOY	Put him over there.
KIRK	A lighting panel.
SPOCK	Amazing in this culture.
REGER	Comes from a time before Landru.
KIRK	Before Landru? How long ago was that?
REGER	Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as six thousand years.
SPOCK	It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this. Inconsistent with this environment
KIRK	But not inconsistent with what we've seen. Security.
KIRK	Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock?
SPOCK	Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions.
MCCOY	He'll be coming around soon, Captain.
REGER	He must not. He's been absorbed.
KIRK	Absorbed?
REGER	The Body absorbs its enemies. It only kills when it has to. When the first Archons came, they were free, out of control, opposing the will of Landru. Many were killed, many more were absorbed. When he regains consciousness, Landru will find us through him. And if the others come
KIRK	What others?
REGER	Those like you and me, who resist Landru.
SPOCK	An underground? How are you organised?
REGER	In threes. Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other.
KIRK	Who?
REGER	I don't know. Tamar was my contact.
MCCOY	Give me a decision, Captain. He's coming out of it.
REGER	He must not regain consciousness. He'll destroy us all. He's of the Body.
KIRK	Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers. This underground. If Landru is so powerful, how do you survive?
REGER	I don't know, Captain. Some of us escape the directives. Not many, but a few. It was that way when the first Archons came.
KIRK	The Archons. Tell me about them.
REGER	They had invaded the Body, but they resisted the will of Landru. You see, Landru had pulled them down from the skies.
KIRK	Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they?
SPOCK	Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.
KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise, come in.
SCOTT	Captain, we're under attack. There are heat beams of some kind coming up from the planet surface.
KIRK	Status report.
SCOTT	Our shields are holding, but they're taking all our power.
SCOTT	If we try to warp out or move on impulse, we'll lose our shields and burn up like a cinder.
KIRK	Orbit condition.
SCOTT	Checking. We're going down, Captain. Unless we can get those beams off us so we can use our engines, we're due to hit atmosphere in less than twelve hours.
KIRK	Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to maintain orbit. We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here.
SCOTT	Impossible to break away. I've tried the emergency bypass circuits but they haven't been effective.
SPOCK	Captain.
KIRK	What is it?
SPOCK	Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this direction.
REGER	Landru.
SPOCK	Block them out.
SPOCK	Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked.
REGER	Oh.
LANDRU	I am Landru.
SPOCK	Projection, Captain. Unreal.
KIRK	But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end.
LANDRU	You have come as destroyers. You bring an infection.
KIRK	You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it.
LANDRU	You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without conflict. No war, no disease, no crime. None of the ancient evils. Landru seeks tranquillity. Peace for all. The universal good.
KIRK	We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will.
LANDRU	The good must transcend the evil. It shall be done. So it has been since the beginning.
SPOCK	He doesn't hear you, Captain.
LINDSTROM	Maybe he'll hear this.
KIRK	Put that away. Landru, listen to me.
LANDRU	You will be absorbed. Your individuality will merge into the unity of the good, and in your submergence into the common being of the Body, you will find contentment and fulfillment. You will experience the absolute good.
REGER	Oh.
KIRK	Captain's log, stardate 3157.4. The Enterprise, still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of Beta Three, is now being commanded by Engineering Officer Scott. The shore party has been taken by the creature called Landru.
KIRK	Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley.
SPOCK	Where's Doctor McCoy?
KIRK	He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister O'Neil.
SPOCK	I should say they've been here and been removed.
KIRK	Where is here?
SPOCK	Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed?
KIRK	No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked.
LINDSTROM	Oh, does my head ache.
SPOCK	The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.
LINDSTROM	Oh, is that what it was?
SPOCK	Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious.
KIRK	Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected?
SPOCK	We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data.
KIRK	Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human?
SPOCK	Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps.
KIRK	Doc. How?
MCCOY	Hello, friend. We were told to wait here.
KIRK	Doc!
MCCOY	Can I help you, friend?
KIRK	Don't you know me?
MCCOY	We all know one another and Landru.
SPOCK	Like Sulu.
KIRK	Think, man. The Enterprise. The ship. Remember?
MCCOY	You speak very strangely, friend. Are you from away?
KIRK	You do remember!
MCCOY	Ask Landru. He remembers. He knows and he watches. You are strange. Are you not of the Body?
LAWGIVER	Come.
KIRK	No.
LAWGIVER	Then you will die.
SPOCK	You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go.
KIRK	All right. Work on Bones. See if you can't
LAWGIVER	Come.
SPOCK	Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him?
MCCOY	He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity. He goes to meet Landru. Happiness is to all of us, blessed by Landru.
MARPLON	I am Marplon. It is your hour. Happy communing.
LAWGIVER	With thanks. Happy communing.
LINDSTROM	Well?
SPOCK	Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control.
LINDSTROM	Are we just going to stand here?
SPOCK	Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door.
LINDSTROM	Well, this is simply ridiculous. A bunch of stone age characters running around in robes.
SPOCK	And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension. Not simple, not ridiculous. Very, very dangerous.
LAWGIVER	You. Come.
KIRK	Joy to you, friend. Peace and contentment will fill you. You will know the peace of Landru.
MARPLON	Have no fear, friend. The effect is harmless. My name is Marplon. I was too late to save your first two friends. They have been absorbed. Beware of them.
SPOCK	What about the Captain?
MARPLON	He is unharmed, unchanged. I am the third man in Reger's triad. We have been awaiting your return.
SPOCK	We are not Archons, Marplon.
MARPLON	Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of prophecy. We ask your help.
SPOCK	Where is Reger?
MARPLON	He will join us. He is immune to absorption. Hurry. We have not much time.
SPOCK	Who is Landru?
MARPLON	I cannot answer your questions now. Landru, he will hear. Here are your weapons. You may need them.
MARPLON	Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is done.
SPOCK	Joy be with you. Peace and contentment.
SPOCK	Captain.
KIRK	Peace and tranquillity to you. Are you all right?
SPOCK	Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy.
KIRK	I understand. Landru.
SPOCK	I am formulating a theory, Captain.
KIRK	And?
SPOCK	Not here. The doctor.
MCCOY	You speak in strange whispers. This is not the way of Landru.
KIRK	Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend.
MCCOY	And peace and harmony. Are you of the Body?
KIRK	The Body is one.
MCCOY	Blessed be the Body, and health to all of its parts.
KIRK	My friends. What is your theory, Mister Spock?
SPOCK	This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark. All is indeed peace and tranquillity. The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine. All parts working in unison.
KIRK	And when something unexplained happens, their routine is disrupted.
SPOCK	Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those orders?
KIRK	Landru.
SPOCK	There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense.
KIRK	You're thinking the same thing I am. Mister Spock, the plug must be pulled.
SPOCK	Sir?
KIRK	Landru must die.
SPOCK	Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference.
KIRK	That refers to a living, growing culture. Do you think this one is?
MCCOY	Joy to you all, friends.
MARPLON	It is the gift of Landru. I've brought your signalling devices. You may need them.
KIRK	What we need is more information about Landru. You said you wanted us to help you.
MARPLON	The prophecy says
KIRK	Never mind what the prophecy says. If you want to be liberated from Landru, we'll need your help.
SPOCK	Captain.
MCCOY	You're not of the Body!
KIRK	Peace
MCCOY	You're not!
KIRK	to you, friend. Joy and tranquillity.
MCCOY	Lawgivers! Peace.
MCCOY	Lawgivers! Traitor! Traitors! Traitors!
KIRK	Doc, I don't want to hurt you.
MCCOY	Traitors!
KIRK	Spock.
KIRK	Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? Robes.
KIRK	Where is Landru?
MARPLON	No, no.
KIRK	Where do we find him?
MARPLON	We do not see him. We hear him, in the Hall of Audiences.
KIRK	In this building?
MARPLON	Yes.
KIRK	You're going to take us there. Spock, call the Enterprise.
MARPLON	No.
KIRK	Snap out of it! Start acting like men.
SPOCK	Spock to Enterprise. status report.
SCOTT	Mister Spock, I've been trying to reach you.
SPOCK	Report, Scott.
SCOTT	The orbit's still decaying. I give it six hours, more or less.
SCOTT	Those heat beams are still on us. You've got to cut them off, Mister Spock, or we'll cook.
KIRK	Scotty, stand by. We're doing the best we can. How's Mister Sulu?
SCOTT	He's peaceful enough, but he worries me.
KIRK	Put a guard on him.
SCOTT	On Sulu?
KIRK	That's an order. Watch him. Captain out.
SPOCK	Captain.
KIRK	All right. About Landru.
REGER	There was war. Convulsions. The world was destroying itself. Landru was our leader. He saw the truth. He changed the world. He took us back, back to a simple time. A time of peace and tranquillity.
KIRK	What happened to him?
MARPLON	He's still alive. He is here now. He sees. He hears. We have destroyed ourselves. Please, no more.
KIRK	You said you wanted freedom. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Come on. We're going to find Landru.
REGER	No, no, I was wrong! I submit, I bear myself to the will of Landru!
KIRK	It's too late for that.
REGER	No! Lawgivers! Help! Help me!
KIRK	All right, it's up to you. Take us to Landru.
MARPLON	This is the Hall of Audiences.
KIRK	Open it.
MARPLON	But this is Landru.
KIRK	Open it.
MARPLON	Landru speaks here.
KIRK	Landru! Landru. We are the Archons. We are the Archons. We've come to speak. We are the Archons. We want to talk to you.
MARPLON	Landru! He comes!
LANDRU	Despite my efforts to save you, you have invaded the Body and you are causing great harm.
KIRK	We have no intention of causing harm.
LANDRU	Obliteration is necessary. The infection is strong. For the good of the Body, you must die. It is a great sorrow.
KIRK	We do not intend to die.
LANDRU	All who saw you, all who know of your presence here must be excised. The memory of the Body will be cleansed.
KIRK	Listen to me.
SPOCK	Useless, Captain. A projection.
KIRK	Yes, Mister Spock. Let's have a look at the projector.
KIRK	Of course. It had to be. Landru.
SPOCK	A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection. Peace, harmony.
KIRK	But no soul.
LANDRU	I am Landru. You have intruded.
KIRK	Pull out its plug, Mister Spock.
LANDRU	Your devices have been neutralised. So it shall be with you. I am Landru.
KIRK	Landru died six thousand years ago.
LANDRU	I am Landru. I am he. All that he was, I am. His experience, his knowledge.
KIRK	But not his wisdom. He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul. You are a machine.
LANDRU	Your statement is irrelevant. You will be obliterated. The good of the Body is the Prime Directive.
SPOCK	The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key.
KIRK	Yes. What is the good?
LANDRU	I am Landru.
KIRK	Landru is dead. You are a machine. A question has been put to you. Answer it.
LANDRU	The good is the harmonious continuation of the Body. The good is peace, tranquillity. The good of the Body is the directive.
KIRK	Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the Prime Directive. You are harmful to the Body.
LANDRU	The body is. It exists. It is healthy.
KIRK	The body is dying. You are destroying it.
LANDRU	Do you ask a question?
KIRK	What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the Body?
LANDRU	Insufficient data.
KIRK	Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity. Without creativity, there is no life. The body dies. The fault is yours.
SPOCK	Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it?
LANDRU	I am not programmed to answer that question.
LAWGIVER	Landru! Guide us, Landru!
SPOCK	Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the first time in their lives.
KIRK	Landru, answer the question.
LANDRU	Peace, order, and tranquillity are maintained. The body lives, but I reserve creativity to me.
SPOCK	Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of the Body.
LANDRU	This is impossible.
MARPLON	Is this truly Landru?
SPOCK	What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago.
KIRK	You must create the good. That is the will of Landru, nothing else.
LANDRU	But there is evil.
KIRK	Then the evil must be destroyed. That is the Prime Directive. And you are the evil.
LANDRU	I think. I live.
KIRK	You are the evil. The evil must be destroyed. Fulfill the Prime Directive.
KIRK	You
LANDRU	Landru, help me!
KIRK	are the evil. Fulfill the Prime Directive.
LANDRU	Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
KIRK	Well, Marplon, you're on your own now. I hope you're up to it. And you can get rid of those robes. If I were you, I'd start look for another job. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
SCOTT	Captain, are you all right?
KIRK	What about the ship?
SCOTT	The heat rays are gone, Captain, and Mister Sulu's back to normal.
SULU	Relieving you.
KIRK	Excellent, Scotty. Stand by to beam up landing party. Let's go and see how the others are doing. Marplon can finish up here.
KIRK	Captain's log, stardate 3158.7 The Enterprise is preparing to leave Beta Three in Star system C One Eleven. Sociologist Lindstrom is remaining behind with a party of experts who will help restore the planet's culture to a human form.
SPOCK	Marvellous.
KIRK	What?
SPOCK	The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings.
KIRK	But only a machine, Mister Spock. The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock.
SPOCK	Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable.
KIRK	You'd make a splendid computer, Mister Spock.
SPOCK	That is very kind of you, Captain.
UHURA	Captain, Mister Lindstrom from the surface.
KIRK	Yes, Lindstrom.
LINDSTROM	I just wanted to say goodbye, Captain.
KIRK	How's it going?
LINDSTROM	Couldn't be better. Already this morning, we've had half a dozen domestic quarrels and two genuine knock-down drag-outs. It may not be paradise, but it's certainly human.
KIRK	Sounds most promising. Good luck.
SPOCK	How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure as the one Landru provided.
KIRK	Yes. And we never got it. Just lucky, I guess.
